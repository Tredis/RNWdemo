# Demo

```$ npm run web``` to start

Compare 'react-datetime' to: https://codepen.io/simeg/pen/mEmQmP

Simple 'react-dropdown' not even showing up: http://fraserxu.me/react-dropdown/

'input-moment' errors out: http://wangzuo.github.io/input-moment/

'react-datetime-calendar' errors out, but can be fixed by changing "file" to "file-loader" in node_modules, but once it displays, it has similar issues as react-datetime. Ex: https://github.com/deepreact/react-datetime-calendar

This leads my to believe I may be doing something wrong with babel/webpack. I just don't know what.
